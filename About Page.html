<h3> Our Story </h3>
<p class="Story">
    We believe that the beauty of fashion should be accessible to everyone, not just the privileged few.
     When the business was founded in 2021, we noticed that fashion stores had to choose between offering choice or reducing 
     inventory pressure and waste. So, we set out to change that by leading the development of alternative processes and technologies
      to bring fashion into the future.
